# DSP_Final_Project

## How to run the program

1) Open up main.m
2) Choose a program of your chose.
	- original: Mix of all sound files in mono channel.
	- example: Example configurations set up manually based on the order of signals in dataframe and pattern.
	- spectral_centroid: Automatic placement of sound signals following spatialization pattern in ascending order of spectral centroid values. 
3) Choose a mode of spatialization. (described in documentation)
4) Set play_sound and  plot_graph variables to true or false as boolean.
5) Check out output file to listen to the spatialization. (All combinations were already created and stored in Output folder.)
